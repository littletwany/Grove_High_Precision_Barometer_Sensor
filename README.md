Grove - High Precision Barometer Sensor
---------------------------------------------------------

Barometer detecting is very useful in enviromental sensing or altitude measuring.The Grove narometer sensor is besed on infineon DPS310,a miniaturized digital barometer air pressure sensor with high accuracy. It can measure pressure range from 300 to 1200 hPa, with ±0.002hPa precision, which means you can detect altitude change within ±2cm at most. The on-board Grove connector allows you to use this sensor plug-and-play with Arduino. 

For all Grove users (especially beginners), we provide you guidance PDF documents. Please download and read through Preface - Getting Started and Introduction to Grove before your using of the product.
 
**Features:**

- Supply voltage: 3.3V/5V 
- Interface: I2C 
- IMeasurement Pressure Range: 300 to 1200hPa 
- Precision: ±0.002hPa or ±0.02cm
 
**Application Ideas:**

- Applications of customer
- Elevation survey 
- Applied to GPS positioning system 
- Location measurement of outdoor activities

### Usage:

This code include an easy example which can show you how to use this grove:It can tell if someone has fallen based on a sudden change in pressure, and it can tell if help is needed.
